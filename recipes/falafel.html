   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>To make authentic, crispy falafel, it is essential to use
dried, uncooked chickpeas soaked overnight, not canned chickpeas.
 The mixture is then pulsed with fresh herbs and spices in a food processor and deep-fried or baked</p>
 <p>
This recipe is for classic, fried falafel. 
 </p>
 <h3>Ingridents</h3>
 <ul>
    <li> cup (about 8 oz or 225g) dried chickpeas, soaked overnight (8-24 hours)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 cup fresh parsley, packed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, packed</li>
    <li> 3-4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1-2 tbsp flour or chickpea flour (for binding, if needed)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>Vegetable or canola oil for frying</li> 
</ul>




    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

    <li>Soak the chickpeas: Place the dried chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with several inches of cold water. </li>
    <li>Add a pinch of baking soda to the water if desired to aid softening. </li>
    <li>Soak for at least 12 hours or overnight, then drain and rinse well.</li>
    <li>Process the mixture: Add the drained chickpeas, onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, 
        cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and baking soda to a food processor. </li>
    <li>Pulse the mixture until it is finely ground and resembles a coarse meal or wet sand,
         but do not blend into a smooth paste (which will make the falafel dense).</li>
    <li>Chill the dough: Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours. </li>
    <li>This helps the mixture bind and prevents the falafel from falling apart during cooking. </li>
    <li>If the mixture still feels too wet after chilling, add a tablespoon of flour and mix well.</li>
    <li>Shape the falafel: Using your hands (moistened slightly to prevent sticking), 
        a small scoop, or a specialized falafel mold, form the mixture into small balls or patties, 
        about 1 to 2 inches in diameter.</li>
    <li>Fry: Heat about 3 inches of oil in a deep pan or pot to a temperature of 350-375°F (175-190°C). </li>
    <li>Carefully lower the falafel balls into the hot oil in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
    <li>Fry until deep golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes total, turning occasionally.</li>
    <li>Drain and serve: Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked falafel to a paper towel-lined
         plate to drain excess oil. </li>
    <li>Serve immediately with warm pita bread, tahini sauce, hummus, and fresh vegetables</li>
</ol>
